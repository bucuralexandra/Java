Problem 2

Expected results:
89.8
79.6

Actual results:
89.8
79.600006

The difference between the 2 values is not big, the reason why the second output appears like that is 
because we use float type for the balance field. Float type is a single-precision floating point, whereas 
double is a double-precision type. This is why sometimes some aproximation errors might appear, minor ones
but maybe important ones. So float is not as precise ad double type can be, but is uses less memory.
