Installing maven: http://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/

For each problem generate a maven project using the following command: 

mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=com.iquestgroup.ju -DartifactId=[weekN.pM] -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart
where N is the week number and M is the problem number. The command generates the folder structure for your project.

You can add dependencies (3rd party libraries) to the generated project by modifying the generated pom.xml file.
Adding jUnit as a dependency:

	 <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.10</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>

Here you can find different dependencies and the xml snippet you have to add to the pom.xml
	http://mvnrepository.com


You can import the generated project in your favourite IDE as a Maven project:
	- for Intellij IDEA: File -> New project -> Import project from external model -> Maven -> Choose the folder containing pom.xml


You've just created your first project using managed dependencies.
Congratulations!
